title:  Writing a Technical Book, Part 2 - Authoring
description:
  In the second post in my series on writing a technical book, I walk through
  my experiences writing the six chapters that would eventually comprise
  Backbone.js Testing. I discuss the ups and downs of working with a
  time-sensitive publisher, finding the time and motivation to write, and
  honing the material down into an actual book.

## Writing a Book

This post is the second in a series on my experiences writing my first
technical book, **[Backbone.js Testing][book_packt]**, published in July, 2013.
In this point, I will walk through authoring the core of the book from writing
the first pages to finishing off the last round of technical edits and ending
up with something (pretty close) to a real book.

## Where we Left Off

In my previous book series post on [starting a book project][book_post01], I
discussed how I got roped into writing a technical book and the process leading
up to me signing up to write "a book". As part of the contract negotiations,
we agreed on the following ultimate chapter outline with estimated page
count and due dates:

1. Setting up a Test Infrastructure (10 pages) - Jan. 8, 2013
2. Creating a Backbone.js Application Test Plan (8 pages) - Jan. 16, 2013
3. Test Assertions, Specs, and Suites (20 pages) - Jan. 28, 2013
4. Test Spies (7 pages) - Feb. 4, 2013
5. Test Stubs and Mocks (15 pages) - Feb. 11, 2013
6. Headless Web Testing (12 pages) - Feb. 19, 2013
7. Appendix A: Other JavaScript Test Frameworks (8 pages) - Feb. 25, 2013

"Writing a Book"
================
* PLAN: Have a sample application and use it as a vehicle for the chapter organizations.
  * Was some question as to how to organize - Backbone.js topics vs. testing topics?

* LOGISTICS:
  * Git Source: BitBucket, GitHub for public samples.
  * MS word went into git as well.
  * TAKEAWAY: Have some regular, reliable backup strategy. I got my computer stolen.


* STORY: Editors in different time zones. Packt
* TIP: Do OS for examples. Source licensing: do OS on GH in addition to publisher's server.
* TIP: Time commitments. And negotiating life events and deadline slippage. And factoring in revision time (after reviews).
  * STORY: Cross-country move.
* TAKEAWAY: Personality attributes that are helpful.
  * Writing fast.
  * Reviewing fast.
  * Don't get bored easily (and you will get bored of your own writing)

* TIP: Editing - Print out a hard copy, get a red pen, and go to town.
* STORY: Original contract dates vs. my draft dates vs. publication slippage dates.
* TIP/STORY: Time commitments.
  * The schedule will slip (unless not aggressive).
  * You will push into weekends, nights, mornings if you have a full time job.
  * Everything will take longer than you think. Maybe a factor of two.
* STORY: Cutting the appendix.
  * A lot of work and research for a minimal payoff (not directly subject-focused).
* STORY: Page count creep and escalation.
