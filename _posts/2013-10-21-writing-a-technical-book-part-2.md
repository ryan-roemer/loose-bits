title:  Writing a Technical Book, Part 2 - Authoring
description:
  In the second post in my series on writing a technical book, I walk through
  my experiences writing the six chapters that would eventually comprise
  Backbone.js Testing. I discuss the ups and downs of working with a
  time-sensitive publisher, finding the time and motivation to write, and
  honing the material down into an actual book.

## Writing a Book




**TODO_HERE: Start outlining, then insert post content**




"Writing a Book"
================
* STORY: Editors in different time zones. Packt
* TIP: Do OS for examples. Source licensing: do OS on GH in addition to publisher's server.
* TIP: Time commitments. And negotiating life events and deadline slippage. And factoring in revision time (after reviews).
  * STORY: Cross-country move.
* TAKEAWAY: Personality attributes that are helpful.
  * Writing fast.
  * Reviewing fast.
  * Don't get bored easily (and you will get bored of your own writing)

* TIP: Editing - Print out a hard copy, get a red pen, and go to town.
* STORY: Original contract dates vs. my draft dates vs. publication slippage dates.
* TIP/STORY: Time commitments.
  * The schedule will slip (unless not aggressive).
  * You will push into weekends, nights, mornings if you have a full time job.
  * Everything will take longer than you think. Maybe a factor of two.
* STORY: Cutting the appendix.
* STORY: Page count creep and escalation.
