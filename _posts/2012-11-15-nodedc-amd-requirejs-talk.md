title:  Shared JavaScript Code with AMD/RequireJS
description: The advent of JavaScript on the backend (with Node.js) has made
  full stack JavaScript applications increasingly popular. RequireJS is
  dependency management framework that simplifies frontend asset management,
  and provides hooks for shared frontend (browser) and backend
  (Node.js) code. In my presentation to the November 11, 2012 Node.DC meetup,
  I introduce how to develop shared JavaScript libraries with
  AMD/RequireJS.

## AMD/RequireJS

The [Asynchronous Module Definition][amd] (*AMD*) provides a framework for
predictable loading of JavaScript modules and dependencies. AMD is an extension
of (and possible transport for) the [CommonJS][cjs] specification.

The [RequireJS][requirejs] library implements AMD with loading, bundling and
other functionality. It brings sensible imports (with `define` and `require`)
to frontend JavaScript, instead of the usual array of script includes into the
global namespace. Interestingly, as [Node.js][nodejs] implements CommonJS-style
`require`'s, there are also support modules to bring Node.js code under AMD.

Take both of things together and we have the real potential for shared
JavaScript code across the browser and server. As we use this exact approach
at work for our new Backbone.js frontend / Express Node.js backend web
application, I created a short talk that I presented at the  November 11, 2012
[Node.DC][node_dc] meetup, entitled "Shared Code with AMD/RequireJS".

## Source Code and Demo

The [source][amd_source] for the presentation is available on GitHub. The
repository further includes all of the [demonstration code][amd_demo] I used to
create a shared JavaScript library and then expose it via the frontend (as
straight JavaScript) and the backend (as a REST service).

The talk and the source give a good overview and run-through of how to implement
simple shared code, but to give a better sense of the final result, here is a
RequireJS-compliant code module (for shuffling elements in a string) that has
an [underscore][underscore] dependency, and works in both the browser
and as a standard module in Node.js:

{% highlight javascript %}
// Node.js hook boilerplate.
// This adds the `define` function to Node.
if (typeof define !== 'function') {
  var define = require('amdefine')(module);
}

// Define wrapper gives us `require`
define(function(require) {
  // Looks like a normal `require` for Node.js.
  // Note: Both browser and Node.js should use
  // the **same** version of libraries.
  var _ = require('underscore');

  // Slice a string into a list of items
  // and return the shuffled values.
  var shuffle = function (val) {
    val = val || "";
    return _.shuffle(val.split(/[\s,]+/));
  };

  // Export our shuffle function by returning.
  return shuffle;
});
{% endhighlight %}

We add some boilerplate at the top of the library for Node.js, then use
the `define` function to make a `require` import function available to both the
browser and Node.js, and we're off and code sharing!

AMD, RequireJS, and shared code are topics that have a lot more depth,
features, and challenges. Hopefully this provides the start to a journey into
better JavaScript dependency management and more extensible full stack web
application development.
