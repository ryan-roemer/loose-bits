title:  Writing a Technical Book, Part 2 - Authoring
description:
  In the second post in my series on writing a technical book, I walk through
  my experiences writing the six chapters that would eventually comprise
  Backbone.js Testing. I discuss the ups and downs of working with a
  time-sensitive publisher, finding the time and motivation to write, and
  honing the material down into an actual book.
