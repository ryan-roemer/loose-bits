## Async.js, a JavaScript Control Flow Library

On February 20, 2012, I gave a talk on [Async.js][asyncjs] to the joint
meetup of [Node.DC][node_dc] and [DC jQuery][dcjq].

Async.js is a control flow library that provides great abstractions for writing
serial, parallel, and combined asynchronous code without ending up in the
dreaded trenches of nested callback insanity.

My [presentation][pres] is available live on GitHub, and uses
[Impress.js][impress] for [Prezi][prezi]-like functionality in the browser.
As a consequence, it might not render in older browsers and IE. My talk covers
the basic abstractions:

* Series
* Waterfalls
* Parallel
* Collections

and more, so check it out and feel free to ping me with any questions or
comments!
