## Finding and Starting a Book Project

I published my first technical book, **[Backbone.js Testing][book_packt]**,
in July, 2013. Now that I am coming down off the high of actually getting the
book out to the world, I thought that I would take a little bit of time to
reflect on my journey and write a series of posts about the adventures and
tribulations of writing a technical book.

In this first post, I will look back on how I got roped into becoming an author,
planning and scoping a prospective book outline, and signing a contract to begin
work on the book.

## Why Write a Book?

Writing a book is an enormous time commitment, puts pressure on your personal
and work obligations, and has little or no chance of being financially a
worthwhile endeavor.

*So, why do it?*

The short answer is that I liked the proposed topic, I was already
interested in writing, and Packt Publishing had some fortuitous timing in
pitching the project.

### A good, challenging topic

Frontend web application testing has been a topic of keen interest and
frustration for me for quite some time. Historically, testing JavaScript in web
pages has been an arduous task, with very few good options and enormous amount
of pain in any solution. At the same time, there is enormous need for this type
of testing as more and more logic is pushed from a traditional backend
application (e.g., a Django or Rails app) to the frontend.

In my day-to-day work over the past few years, I've noticed that the biggest
holes in application test coverage and sources of *most actual bugs* have been
in frontend JavaScript code. Accordingly, I have now spent a good amount of
time implementing and writing about testing on the client side. In 2011,
I wrote [two][envjs_post01] [posts][envjs_post02] on an early frontend testing
solution I came up with using Env.js and Rhino. The technologies were
unreliable and hacked together, but at that point, at least it was *something*.

Fast-forwarding to today, with the rapid rise of Node.js on the backend and a
whole host of new and exciting browser libraries, there are a lot more options
for frontend testing. At Curiosity Media, we had a large Backbone.js web
application that we were able to get a solid, modern test harness around using
[Mocha][mocha], [Chai][chai] and [Sinon.JS][sinon].

### I missed writing

By way of a bit more background, software engineering is my second career.
Before becoming a full-time geek, I was an intellectual property attorney,
focusing on mostly computer software and hardware matters.

While some folks think that the life of a lawyer mostly involves standing up
and arguing in court (e.g., "I object!"), the reality is that as a junior
associate attorney, you spend nearly all of your time reading and writing legal
documents of some type or another. Moreover, as a patent attorney, most of your
time is spent writing patent applications and related legal documents.
And, patent writing is essentially technical writing, albeit with a bit of a
legal bent.

So, coming back to my current life as a software engineer, while I occasionally
write blog posts and articles, it had been several years since any substantive
writing project. And, I kind of missed it.

### And, it seemed like the right time

With that background, [Packt Publishing][packtpub] had the good timing to
approach me with a book proposal for testing Backbone.js applications in late
October of 2012.

I'm not sure the process was particularly selective in my case, as Packt has a
reputation for somewhat aggressive recruitment strategies for book authors and
reviewers (e.g., they send a lot of emails). But, the subject matter was a good
fit for my frontend testing interests, and the book size seemed to make the
project tractable.

## Choosing a Publisher

I didn't really "choose" a publisher, as I was not seriously considering a book
project until Packt presented the packaged concept to me. As such, I didn't go
through the steps of deciding to write a book, then trying to choose a
publisher and whether or not to self-publish - but the topic is one of great
interest to folks I have chatted with incidentally about technical book
authorship.

I will get more into the intricacies of working with my specific publisher
throughout the rest of these posts. As to the broad question of working with
a traditional publisher versus a self-publishing service like
[Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/), the things that my publisher helped with that
were really valuable includes the following:

* **Technical Reviewers**: Packt recruited two community JavaScript developers
  to review the technical content for accuracy and suggestions. The reviewers
  for my book were absolutely top notch, and provided enormously useful
  feedback and comments.
* **Content Editing**: A normal publishing house will provide proofreaders and
  content editors to fix language and writing errors. Packt does not always
  have the best reputation in this regard, so in my authoring, I viewed the
  final responsibility for all editing being my own. At the same time, the
  editors and proofreaders did find several misspellings, etc. over the course
  of my drafts.
* **Layout and Formatting**: A publishing house will take care of all of the
  formatting issues, particularly those that require manual editing after the
  automated processes finish producing a print-worthy PDF. I'm not sure how
  far along the self-publishing services are in this regard, and in any case
  I didn't have to do any of this work - I just had to review and approve
  the print-ready PDFs.
* **Publishing and Distribution**: Packt takes care of the publication in
  paper and eBook form. They also got the book listed on Amazon and other
  third party sites with proper metadata, etc. (although they needed a
  couple of rounds to get it right).
* **Marketing**: Traditional publishing houses will also market your book via
  email, website articles, and other means to get the word out in ways you
  won't always be able to do yourself. In my case, Packt is in the process of
  creating an article around some of the book content to publish on their site
  and drive interest. Then, they'll launch and email and social media campaign.
  I have no idea how that will go, but it should be interesting to see if it
  actually drums up more interest.

From what I can intuit, the disadvantages of going with a traditional publisher
include:

* **Control**: Someone else is approving drafts and driving the entire process.
* **People and Resources**: As an author, you are one of many to the publisher,
  and if they haven't staffed your book properly, you can end up waiting a long
  time for the project to move forward. As one example in my case, after I
  finished all of the drafts for the book, Packt sat on the book for an entire
  month without progress as they had some internally shuffling of editors and
  staff.
* **Pressure**: With a traditional publishing house, you are on someone else's
  time line, and in Packt's case, they drove really hard to getting drafts
  in. At the same time, some authors might enjoy having a third party provide
  incentive to keep with the project.

Would I self-publish my next book? I'm not sure. (I'm still not sure I'll ever
write another technical book.) But, were I to go down the authoring rabbit hole
once again, I would strongly consider self-publishing given the advances and
control you have over the entire process.

In any case, as far as my story here goes, I ended up with Packt. And I will
say that in my case, the book was most likely finished much faster with Packt
than with any of the other publishing options or companies.

## The Book Proposal

My first contact with Packt was from an "author relationship executive", which
I think is something like an author recruiter. The tentative project outline
Packt proposed was for a 90-page book with five chapters covering Backbone.js
application testing concepts and tools.

Once I expressed some interest, the author relationship executive passed me on
to a "commissioning editor", who is the main editor for the book. I would
later find out that there are various editor roles, as well as many different
people iterating through those roles during the course of writing the book.

The commissioning editor answered my initial queries and communicated the
basic logistics of the book - drafts are written in Microsoft Word,
the loose drafting and editorial process, etc. The expected page count got
ramped down to 80 pages, which Packt considers a "mini" book - a short,
concise book on a specific topic.

The editor then sent me a helper "outline kit" for me to put together a target
outline for the book, which added up to 60 pages of content. The goal was to
fill in a per-chapter outline for each of the five proposed chapters. I did
this, then proposed an additional chapter (on automated web testing) and
an appendix. The Packt team liked the outline and my suggested additions, and
bumped the allowed page count to 80 pages.

After a bit more back and forth, I finished a final draft of the book outline,
which Packt approved, and then we moved forward to the contract stage. The
takeaway from the proposal process was that we ironed out the chapter structure
and length, which would then constrain the writing process and define what parts
were going to be due.

## The Book Contract

After approving the book proposal, Packt sent me a book contract for review.
The contract most entailed expected details of obligations for the author in
writing the book, what happens if the author fails to deliver chapters or
stop working on the book, etc.

### The legalese

Although sometimes scary and written in abstruse legalese, a contract is
essentially a negotiation in paper form. An important thing to remember that
any point is up for grabs, modifiable or removable. With that in mind, I dove
into the contract and started dissecting some of the points that might need
changes.

One of the biggest issues with the contract was that Packt put in a clause
titled "Option on future Works", which basically obligated me to give Packt the
first right to publish my *next two books* after the one we were discussing.

> The Author shall give the Publisher the first opportunity to read and consider
> for publication the next 2 works on any computer-related subject that the
> Author seeks to have published.

To me, this clause was clearly ridiculous - it is one thing to agree to a book
contract when I've never written one before nor worked with Packt before, but
it's quite another to say the first **three** books I would write would be at
Packt's publishing discretion. So, I asked Packt to remove the clause
entirely.

A separate issue that wasn't directly addressed in the contract was the
licensing of the code samples that accompanied the book. The code samples
technically fall under the copyrights of the book generally. However, I
wanted to release all of the code samples as an open source project, so that
I could easily publish the code, get community improvements and bug fixes,
and get the code out earlier than the book. So, I asked that Packt allow all
of the code samples to be separately published to GitHub as an open source
project under the MIT license (the most common license for the components
I was using).

Packt agreed to both changes without any further issue or push back.

### The time frame

Packt set up an incredibly aggressive time frame for completing the first
drafts of the book - something short of two months. As I had planned a December
vacation, I pushed back a little bit and got the following schedule
(assuming a starting date of January) for my chapter drafts:

1. Setting up a Test Infrastructure - Jan. 8, 2013
2. Creating a Backbone.js Application Test Plan - Jan. 16, 2013
3. Test Assertions, Specs, and Suites - Jan. 28, 2013
4. Test Spies - Feb. 4, 2013
5. Test Stubs and Mocks - Feb. 11, 2013
6. Headless Web Testing - Feb. 19, 2013
7. Appendix A: Other JavaScript Test Frameworks - Feb. 25, 2013

In retrospect, this schedule was **insane** and was in no way feasible given
that I had a full time job and was expecting to write on nights and weekends.
But, the story of the how all of the deadlines (both mine and my publisher's)
slipped over the course of the book is for another post.

Suffice to say that I should have padded the draft chapter due dates
in the contract by at least a factor of 1.5 from what I have here. Being a
first time author, I really had no real idea how long things would actually
take, and my intuition now tells me that drafting chapters is slower your
first time.

### The money

The contract also specified the remuneration details - advance and royalties.
Packt's royalty rate is 16% of all book revenue, and is explained in further
detail on their [royalties page](http://authors.packtpub.com/content/royalties).

The advance amount was pretty minimal - $600 - with one-fourth due on
completion of all drafts, and the rest due on publication. As an *advance*,
you get to keep this amount, but it cuts against any royalties from the book
after publication until it is accounted for.

Unless you happen to have an amazing prolific topic, money should not be a
large motivating factor in choosing to write a technical book as you will
invariably be disappointed. You'll note that money was nowhere in my
discussion of motivations to write a book in the above sections.

Software developers are fairly well-paid; authors
tend not to be. Put another way, I have never done the math as to how many
hours I spent writing the book versus how much I *could* have made in side
software consulting gigs, nor do I plan to in the future - the opportunity cost
in terms of pure dollars would be really depressing.

At the same time, I *did* find so many benefits from writing a technical book -
learning a subject in depth, working with development communities in depth,
and just meeting random folks along the way who were interested in the topic
or have even read the book or online code samples.

## Off to Write a Book

Having considered everything and deciding to jump in,
I signed the revised book contract with Packt in December, 2012 and officially
became on the hook for writing a book. Packt then sent me an "author
bundle" of documents, which included style and writing guidelines and templates
for the draft chapters.

Packt uses Microsoft Word (or OpenOffice) documents for drafting and relies
on custom styles to eventually reformat the book for publication. I would
much have preferred to use a text-based document approach such as Markdown
or LaTeX, because there is so much more control over the document content
and structure, and code examples are much more likely to be properly
preserved.

And with these reference materials and a loose outline of my topic in hand, I
began writing the draft of my first chapter...

(*And I'll pick up the authoring adventure from this point on in the next
post in this series.*)
