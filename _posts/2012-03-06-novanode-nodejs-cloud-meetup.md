## Node.js in NoVA!

We recently launched the [NovaNode meetup][meetup] group focusing on the
[Node.js][nodejs] event-driven JavaScript framework. We have a great set
of talks lined up for our [inaugural meetup event][meetup_event] on March 20,
2012 at 6:30 pm. We're hosting things at [SpanishDict][sd]'s offices in
Arlington, VA near the Clarendon metro stop.

Our talks are:

* **"Getting Started with Node.js in the Cloud"**, which I'll present.
* **"Everyauth: OAuth for Busy Nerds"** by Jason Bond Pratt, Co-founder of
  [Tixelated][tixelated]. OAuth is the standard interface for web services
  integration for user authentication, and is your starting point for linking
  an application to Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc. Jason's talk will take
  us through Everyauth's basic architecture and integration with other data
  stores like MongoDB.

## Getting Started with Node.js in the Cloud

My talk will center around basic Node.js application development and
deployment to the cloud.
