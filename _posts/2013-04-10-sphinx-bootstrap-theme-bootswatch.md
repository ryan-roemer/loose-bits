## Bringing Bootswatch to Sphinx

The [Bootstrap Theme][sbt_gh] for [Sphinx][sphinx] documentation continues to
evolve, and I'm pleased to announce the v0.2.0 release. The theme integrates
[Twitter][twitter]'s [Bootstrap][bootstrap] library into Sphinx,
and v0.2.0 adds new support for [Bootswatch][bootswatch] CSS extensions, which
provide a lot of great new UI possibilities for your documentation. We've
also internally updated to Bootstrap 2.3.1.

The project's [demonstration site][sbt_demo_readme] now uses the
"[united](http://bootswatch.com/united/)" Bootswatch theme to give a clean
and well... *orange-ish* feel to the site. Here is a screenshot of the
demonstration site in a desktop viewport:

The project is available for download from [GitHub][sbt_gh] and
[PyPi][sbt_pypi]. You are encouraged to update and try out some Bootswatch
goodness!

## Adding Bootswatch

As a preliminary note, the use of Bootswatch themes is entirely optional, and
disabled by default - the project starts with a vanilla Bootstrap appearance,
which you can customize to your heart's content. To enable a specific
Bootswatch theme, set the following option in your
"[conf.py][sbt_demo_cfg]" file:

{% highlight python %}
html_theme_options = {
    # Bootswatch (http://bootswatch.com/) theme.
    #
    # Options are nothing with "" (default) or the name of a valid theme such
    # as "amelia" or "cosmo".
    #
    # Note that this is served off CDN, so won't be available offline.
    'bootswatch_theme': "united",
}
{% endhighlight %}

The list of Bootswatch themes you can now try out include:

* [**amelia**](http://bootswatch.com/amelia/)
* [**cerulean**](http://bootswatch.com/cerulean/)
* [**cosmo**](http://bootswatch.com/cosmo/)
* [**cyborg**](http://bootswatch.com/cyborg/)
* [**journal**](http://bootswatch.com/journal/)
* [**readable**](http://bootswatch.com/readable/)
* [**simplex**](http://bootswatch.com/simplex/)
* [**slate**](http://bootswatch.com/slate/)
* [**spacelab**](http://bootswatch.com/spacelab/)
* [**spruce**](http://bootswatch.com/spruce/)
* [**superhero**](http://bootswatch.com/superhero/)
* [**united**](http://bootswatch.com/united/)

As a final note, the Bootstrap CSS files are served off of **CDN**, which means
that if you are offline, your site will have a non-themed, vanilla Bootstrap
appearance. We are considering refactoring the Bootswatch code to be available
offline as well.
