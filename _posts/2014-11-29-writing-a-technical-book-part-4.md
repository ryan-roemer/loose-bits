## Marketing &amp; Post-Publication

In my fourth and final post about my adventure writing
**[Backbone.js Testing][book_packt]**, I take a look back on what has
happened since the book was published in July, 2013. While I am sure this
experience really varies for different authors and books, the high-level
takeaways I found post-publication are:

* `TODO_OUTLINE`

For those just catching up, here are some quick links to the previous posts
in this series:

## Marketing &amp; Selling a Book

In my previous post on [publishing a book][book_post03], I discussed all of the
final legwork needed to translate the drafts of the entire book into something
that you could purchase online or in a book store. And, on July 12th, 2013,
my publisher (Packt) declared we had cleared all final hurdles and that the
book was published and available for purchase.

Immediately thereafter, my publisher's attention understandably turned to a
strong effort to sell the book.

### Technical Article

`TODO_SECTION`

```
Shreerang Deshpande - 7/12/13, 3:32 AM

As the book is uploaded, we need a section from the book to create an article, which goes on our website-http://www.packtpub.com/article-network. The article should  only be of 5 pages. A section that is used as an article should contain important keywords related to our technology that potential customers  will query on search engines. Such customers might land up on our website and buy the book. So please suggest a SEO-friendly section for the article.

It would be great if I have the article selected by tomorrow.

In addition to this, I have mailed the products team about incorrect information being displayed about the page count and the price. The changes should be amended in 48 hours.
