## Publishing a Book

At long last, this is the third post in a series on my experiences writing
**[Backbone.js Testing][book_packt]**, published in July, 2013. In this post,
I'll dive into the publication process and subsequent marketing of my book.

`TODO: Add overview bullet points`

## You've Written a Book - Now What?

In my previous post on [authoring a book][book_post02], I recount writing the
individual chapters of the book, going through technical and editorial review,
and submitting the "final" draft for publication at the end of April, 2013.

After this final submission, I asked the publisher's project folks what to
expect from there on until actual "on the shelves" publication and was told
that the process for each chapter was something along the lines of:

* Technical editing.
* Copy editing
* Indexing key terms
* Layout adjustments for actual, rendered book pages
* Proofreading
* "Prefinal" submission for the author's final review
* Finalization and clubbing

Each of those steps was forecast to take 1-2 days and to be run in parallel
for all the chapters.
