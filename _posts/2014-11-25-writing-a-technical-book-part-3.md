## Publishing a Book

At long last, this is the third post in a series on my experiences writing
**[Backbone.js Testing][book_packt]**, published in July, 2013. In this post,
I'll dive into the publication process and subsequent marketing of my book.

`TODO: Add overview bullet points`

## You've Written a Book - Now What?

In my previous post on [authoring a book][book_post02], I recount writing the
individual chapters of the book, going through technical and editorial review,
and submitting the "final" draft for publication at the end of April, 2013.

After this final submission, I asked the publisher's project folks what to
expect from there on until actual "on the shelves" publication and was told
that the process for each chapter was something along the lines of:

* Technical editing.
* Copy editing
* Indexing key terms
* Layout adjustments for actual, rendered book pages
* Proofreading
* "Prefinal" submission for the author's final review
* Finalization and clubbing

Each of those steps was forecast to take 1-2 days and to be run in parallel
for all the chapters.

It was at that time that I also reminded Packt that we still needed to formally
update the book's title from "Backbone Testing" to "Backbone.js Testing" in
all of the materials, something Packt repeatedly told me was easy to do
throughout the process.

## A Break + How Hard Can a Title Change Be?

As Packt had pushed hard the entire time I was writing my chapters to get
everything done as fast as possible, I was surprised to hear mostly radio
silence for around twenty days. Finally, I started poking around Packt's
website to see if they had started any pre-publication activity, and to
my pleasant surprise, they had -- putting up a web page for my book.

_Unfortunately_, they somehow managed to screw up my title change request and
renamed the book to "Testing Backbone.js. Issues aside about the difficulty
of getting two simple words right and in the correct order, I was extremely
disappointed -- a publishing house should be able to correctly assign a book
title. And, Packt had submitted the incorrect title for pre-publication book
pages to Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and other online book retailers.

Somehow making things worse, the page that Packt put up for pre-publication was
nonsensically worded in it's description of the book and why prospective readers
should buy it -- with repeatedly copy-and-pasted sentences and gems like "Test
your web applications using backbone's tried and tested techniques and industry
best practices". (For those not familiar with Backbone.js, just trust me that
the last statement is pure technical gibberish).

So, I emailed my commissioning editor, only to find out that they had been on
break for some time (which probably explained the break with no activity). I
finally tracked down my previous commissioning editor, and roped them in to
fixing the mess on the webpage.

It turns out that Packt had just been more or less guessing at the marketing
and book cover metadata -- bullet points about why to purchase the book, the
title tagline, etc. I reviewed everything online and for the actual book cover
and basically rewrote everything for the publisher so as to actually make sense
from the point of view of an actual prospective reader, and hopefully make the
book seem like a good purchase.

Through all of this mess, there were some actual silver linings. I got to
actually choose a picture for the book cover, which I chose from one of my
wife's photographs from nearby our house. Here's the cover again for
reference:

<div class="pull-center">
  <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/backbonejs-testing/book">
    <img class="bordered"
         style="width: 50%; max-width: 250px;"
         alt="Backbone.js Testing"
         title="Backbone.js Testing"
         src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}media/img/2013/06/13/book-cover.jpg" />
  </a>
  <p />
</div>

And, I did learn about _all_ of the details of the book cover and website
marketing content because I was so paranoid about something else inaccurate or
nonsensical being written on my behalf about the book.

## Prefinal and Final Editing

After the diversion of the book title / marketing material, Packt finally
got the first chapters back to me for prefinal review on May 30th, supposedly
targeting a "to the printers" date of June 10th.
