title:  5 Things I Like About CoffeeScript
description: CoffeeScript is programming language that compiles to JavaScript.
  I gave a short survey talk about a few CoffeeScript features that I really
  like to the August 15, 2012 Node.DC meetup.

## CoffeeScript

[CoffeeScript][cs] is self-described as "a little language that compiles into
JavaScript". CoffeeScript implements a subset of the full JavaScript language
and adds a little bit of common boilerplate code to take out some of the
less savory parts of JavaScript. CoffeeScript works both in [Node.js][nodejs]
on the backend, as well as in the browser.

I gave a short survey talk at the August 15, 2012 [Node.DC][node_dc] meetup,
"5 Things I Like About CoffeeScript".

The talk's [source][cs_source] is available live on GitHub, and uses the
awesome [deck.js][deck] presentation framework with the
[CodeMirror plugin][deck_cm], so that the code samples are editable. I
further hacked up the CodeMirror plugin to make both the JavaScript and
the CoffeeScript code examples editable and runnable from most browsers.

## Five Cool Things in CoffeeScript

For the impatient, the five topics I covered are:

1. Syntax
2. Functions
3. Classes
4. Existential Operator
5. Loops, Comprehensions

The talk just skims the surface of the powerful (yet slim) CoffeeScript
language. For further reading / real introductory tutorials, I would suggest:

* [CoffeeScript Documentation][cs]: The official API.
* [The CoffeeScript Cookbook][cs_cook]: Lots of "recipes" for common
  programming problems and projects.
* [Smooth Coffeescript][smooth]: Interactive online eBook with live
  code execution and editing.
