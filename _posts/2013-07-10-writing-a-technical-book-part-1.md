## Finding and Starting a Book Project

This is the first in a series of posts describing my adventures and
tribulations in the course of writing my first technical book,
**[Backbone.js Testing][book_packt]**. In this post, I will look back on how
I got roped into becoming an author, planning and scoping a prospective book
outline and signing a contract to begin work on the book.

## Some Background






General - First Post
====================
* NOTE: Qualifier - My background is perhaps a little different than most tech. writers. A patent / litigation attorney is essentially a technical writer with a very arcane publishing goal.
* TAKEAWAY: Personality attributes that are helpful.
  * Writing fast.
  * Reviewing fast.
  * Don't get bored easily (and you will get bored of your own writing)

"Finding and Starting a Project"
================================
* TIP: Review and negotiate the contract. It's an open discussion, not a "take it or leave it" proposition.
* TIP: Don't do it for the money. And, don't ever try and calculate what your effective hourly rate is. Reasons to do it: (1) learn a new subject, (2) get your name out there in a (new) area.
* TIP: Do OS for examples. Source licensing: do OS on GH in addition to publisher's server.
* TIP: Time commitments. And negotiating life events and deadline slippage. And factoring in revision time (after reviews).
  * STORY: Cross-country move.
* STORY: Editors in different time zones. Packt


## TODO - Book description stuff.

I am very pleased to announce that I am in the last stages of publishing
**[Backbone.js Testing][book_packt]** - a book on [Backbone.js][backbone] test
architecture and development due in final form around the end of June.

A brief abstract of the book's content is available from the
[Packt Publishing][packtpub] [website][book_packt]:
