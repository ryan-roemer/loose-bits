## Bringing Twitter Bootstrap to Sphinx

[Bootstrap][bootstrap] is a CSS/JS framework that provides base typography,
layout (grids), forms / form inputs, tables and navigation, and has been
gaining wide popularity among developers. In my personal experience with a
couple of sites and projects, [Bootstrap][bootstrap] really provides a great
starting point for a frontend that provides good extensibility over time.

[Sphinx][sphinx] is the most popular [Python][python] documentation generator
tool. It has fantastic Python module docstring / comment parsing in addition
to a sensible static pages framework, providing a great final web site built
from both inline code documentation and outside web pages.
