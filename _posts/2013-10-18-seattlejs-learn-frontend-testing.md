## Learn Frontend Testing

As a part of [Formidable Labs'][fmd] series of development education events, I
led a "[Learn Frontend Testing][meetup_event]" workshop on Oct. 16, 2013 for
the [SeattleJS][meetup] meetup group. My slides are available at the following
locations:

* [**Web Presentation**](http://formidablelabs.github.com/learn-frontend-testing/): A live,
  navigable [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) website.
  (*Note*: use the space bar to advance slides and arrow keys to navigate.)
* [**PDF**](http://formidablelabs.github.com/learn-frontend-testing/learn-frontend-testing.pdf):
  A download-able PDF.

And, here's an embedded format:

</div>

## Workshop Topics

My presentation walks through testing some very basic JavaScript application
code in the following steps:

* Install all of the necessary test libraries and create a test driver HTML page
  to hook up the application libraries and run the whole test harness.
* Create Mocha suites and tests.
* Write assertions to verify application behavior with Chai.
* Spy and stub out application behavior with Sinon.JS.
* Automate all of our tests with PhantomJS to run them from the command line
  without a web browser.

The test stack the presentation uses is:

* **[Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/)**: Test framework for
  organizing and running our tests.
* **[Chai](http://chaijs.com/)**: Natural language-focused test assertion
  library.
* **[Sinon.JS](http://sinonjs.org/)**: Test fake library providing spies
  and stubs for observing and mutating application behavior during tests.

The test concepts and technology stack is the same one I use in my book,
**[Backbone.js Testing][book_packt]**. You can see the additional test samples
beyond those contained in the presentation at:
[http://backbone-testing.com/](http://backbone-testing.com/).
