Writing a Technical Book - Notes
================================

Overview
========

Series plan:

* "Finding and Starting a Project": Contact, Accept, Book Plan, Contract, Start Writing.
* "Writing a Book": Drafts, First three chapters, Technical reviews, last three chapters, omitting the appendix.
* "Publishing a Book": Prefinals, Finals, Website, Book Sites (Amazon, etc.)

General - First Post
====================
* NOTE: Qualifier - My background is perhaps a little different than most tech. writers. A patent / litigation attorney is essentially a technical writer with a very arcane publishing goal.
* TAKEAWAY: Personality attributes that are helpful.
  * Writing fast.
  * Reviewing fast.
  * Don't get bored easily (and you will get bored of your own writing)

"Finding and Starting a Project"
================================
* TIP: Review and negotiate the contract. It's an open discussion, not a "take it or leave it" proposition.
* TIP: Don't do it for the money. And, don't ever try and calculate what your effective hourly rate is. Reasons to do it: (1) learn a new subject, (2) get your name out there in a (new) area.
* TIP: Do OS for examples. Source licensing: do OS on GH in addition to publisher's server.
* TIP: Time commitments. And negotiating life events and deadline slippage. And factoring in revision time (after reviews).
  * STORY: Cross-country move.
* STORY: Editors in different time zones. Packt

"Writing a Book"
================
* TIP: Editing - Print out a hard copy, get a red pen, and go to town.
* STORY: Original contract dates vs. my draft dates vs. publication slippage dates.
* TIP/STORY: Time commitments.
  * The schedule will slip (unless not aggressive).
  * You will push into weekends, nights, mornings if you have a full time job.
  * Everything will take longer than you think. Maybe a factor of two.

"Publishing a Book"
===================
* STORY: Issues w/ the title / subtitle / description thing. You have to take control of the situation.
