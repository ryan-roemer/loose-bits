I am a software engineer interested in full-stack development, cloud computing,
and the collision of law and technology. I am the CTO and a co-founder
of **[Formidable Labs](http://formidablelabs.com/)**, where I lead software
development and architecture, with an emphasis on test methodologies,
mentorship, and application design.

Recounting things roughly in chronological order, I was a programmer at a small
San Diego startup during the late 1990's dot-com boom and meltdown. The bust
sent me off to law school, after which I became a patent attorney with a large
international law firm, splitting my time between patent prosecution and
litigation. I eventually realized that my software clients were having more fun
creating new systems and products than I was writing about their work, so I
decided to go back to graduate school in Computer Science.

After receiving my masters at [UCSD](http://cse.ucsd.edu), I joined the
[Windows Azure](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/) team at Microsoft as a
software engineer in the Cloud Computing storage group, working with really
large-scale distributed systems. I then merged both my patent law and
computer science backgrounds as a senior engineer at
[IP Street](http://www.ipstreet.com/), working on intellectual property data
mining. Since IP Street, I was the Director of Engineering at
Curiosity Media, which hosts [SpanishDict](http://spanishdict.com), the world's
largest Spanish learning website, before finding my way home to
[Formidable Labs](http://formidablelabs.com/).
