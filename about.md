I am a software engineer interested in big data, cloud computing, and the
collision of law and technology.

Recounting things roughly in chronological order, I was a programmer at a small
San Diego startup during the dot-com boom and meltdown. The bust sent me off to
law school, after which I became a patent attorney with a large international
law firm, splitting my time between patent prosecution and litigation.
I eventually realized that my software clients were having more fun creating
new systems and products than I was writing about their work, so I decided to
go back to graduate school in Computer Science.

After receiving my masters at [UCSD](http://cse.ucsd.edu), I joined the
[Windows Azure](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/) team at Microsoft as a
software engineer in the Cloud Computing storage group, working with really
large-scale distributed systems. 

I am presently a senior engineer at [IP Street](http://www.ipstreet.com/),
a Seattle-based startup, working with intellectual property data analysis.
So after a couple of different graduate programs and careers, I am now actually
using both my engineering and law degrees...
